# Project Î£

It has the simple aim to use genetically created BRAINFUCK-Code to apriximate mathmatical functions.
For intialization, the Code is stored in Prog Objects and randomly generated and executed until it doesn't return errors anymore.
Then the Evolution's part takes place and the fittness determines iteration after iteration, which ones survive and are aallowed to replicate (also so long, as it takes to make possible programs...)
