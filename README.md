# Project Î£

It has the simple aim to use generically created BRAINFUCK-Code to apriximate mathmatical functions.
For intialization, the Code is stored in Prog Objects and randomly generated and executed until it doesn't return errors anymore.
Then the Evolution's part takes place and the fittness determines iteration after iteration, which ones survive and are allowed to replicate.
The success is quite low. Liear and similarily simple funktions are reached, but only the second layer of iteration (square function) is too complex to occur randomly.
